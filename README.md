# React Starter App

### About

[React Starter App][rsa] an open-source boilerplate for building and deploying
static React web apps quickly. Use it to kickstart your next project, landing page,
documentation site, or personal blog! It's also a great place for beginners to learn about
building modern, static, single-page applications with React.

React Starter App is built on top of [React Static Boilerplate][rsb] (RSB) and borrows heavily
from its build tooling - I designed React Starter App while learning about React and tweaking
RSB to suit my own preferences and needs for a React boilerplate.
