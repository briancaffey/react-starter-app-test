> React Static Boilerplate (RSB) is a boilerplate and tooling for creating modern stand-alone
web applications (aka SPAs) for a serverless architecture. RSB significantly reduces cost by
eliminating the need for servers such as EC2 instances because the entire site can be hosted
directly from CDN (Firebase, GitHub Pages, Amazon S3, or other similar cloud storage). Sites
built with RSB can be fully functional with REST API or GraphQL calls to micro-services such
as Amazon Lambda, Azure Functions, or dynamic Docker endpoints hosted on DigitalOcean. RSB
demonstrates how to use component-based UI development approach with best of breed technologies
including React, Redux, Babel, Webpack, Browsersync, React Hot Loader and more.

React Static Boilerplate has a ton of state-of-the-art features; I can't recommend it enough.

### Why React Starter?

While using RSB, I stripped out some core integrations from the original project and found myself
reusing the bare-bones version enough times that I decided to spawn this project.

Major departures from RSB:

1. [Redux integration removed](#redux)
1. [React Router used instead of first-party solution]()
1. [React-MDL integration removed]()
1. [CSS reset]()

Notes and design thoughts for each topic are listed below.
