Welcome to [React Starter App][github] - a modern, open-source React boilerplate that is a
good starting point to learn about, build, and deploy a full-fledged, static,
single-page React application served blazingly fast by a static content hosting service
like [Firebase][firebase] or [Amazon S3][s3].

<br>

React Starter App is based on another great project - [React Static Boilerplate][rsb] - and
borrows from much of its tooling and infrastructure. Read more about the motivation for this
project and the differences between the two projects in the [docs](/docs#motivation).

<br>

For a Redux-integrated variant of this project, check out the sister project: [Redux Starter App][redux-starter-app].

### Features

React Starter App features a modern development, build, and testing toolchain including:

<br>

- [CSS Modules][css-modules] for writing modular and composable CSS
- [Markdown-it][md-it] and a custom markdown loader for rendering markdown as HTML
- [Babel][babel] for transpiling application code from ES6+ to ES5
- [Webpack][webpack] for bundling files, and allowing [Hot Module Replacement][hmr] in development
- [ESlint][eslint] and [Stylelint][stylelint] for linting .js and .css, respectively
- [Mocha][mocha] and [Enzyme][enzyme] for unit testing React components
